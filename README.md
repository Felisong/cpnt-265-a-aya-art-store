# Hello, welcome to Reika's Art Store Repository

My name is Carolina. I am a web dev student trying to create an operational e-commerce site in 2 weeks. I at this point have created a minimum viable product.I am happy to say that I have learned a lot of this.

This project is for my friend who has an etsy store : [link here](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ReikasArt)

Here is a link to the [deployed site](https://reikas-art-felisongs-projects.vercel.app)
Here is a link to my [github repo (what you're currently on)](https://github.com/Felisong/cpnt-265-a-aya-art-store.git)

it is intended to be a show of an e commerce site built by me.

I will provide a table of contents below for ease of navigation
